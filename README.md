Search Logger - log a search
============================

Have you always wanted to know what visitors are searching for at your DokuWiki? This plugin uses the search events to detect a search and store it anonymously in a database. Via the configuration manager, you can set the connection data to your database (requires databaseconnector plugin).
When the search is complete, this plugin adds some statistical information and an additional search field to the output.
